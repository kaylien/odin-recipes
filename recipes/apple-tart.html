        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> My mother used to cook this for us all, usually to go with Sunday dinner. I was hooked. Haven't had 
            it in ages and I was wanting to bake something special for a special someone so I asked mum for the 
            recipe. Tried it out today, and it's just as I remember. The thing that makes it for me is the 
            frangipane. Hope you like it as much as me.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Pastry</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Frangipane</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon apple brandy</li>
                <li>⅔ cup ground almonds</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>4 medium sweet apples - peeled, cored, halved and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar for decoration</li>
                <li>¼ cup apricot jelly</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together 1 1/3 cups of flour and salt. Add the butter, 1 egg yolk and water, 
                and stir until the mixture forms large crumbs. If it is too dry to press a handful together, stir in 
                more water. Press the dough into a ball, and wrap in plastic wrap. Flatten slightly, and refrigerate 
                for at least 30 minutes, or until firm. This part can be done up to three days in advance.</li>

            <li>To make the frangipane, cream together the butter and 1/2 cup of sugar in a medium bowl until light 
                and soft. Gradually mix in the egg and the remaining egg yolk one at a time. Stir in the apple brandy. 
                Stir 2 tablespoons of flour into the ground almonds, then mix into the batter. Set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Roll the pastry dough out to about a 12 inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Fold loosely into 
                quarters, and center the point in a 10 inch tart or pie pan. Unfold dough, and press into the bottom 
                and up the sides. Prick with a fork all over, and flute the edges. Return pastry to the refrigerator 
                to chill until firm.</li>
            
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a baking sheet inside the oven while it preheats.</li>
            
            <li>Spoon the frangipane into the chilled pastry, and spread into an even layer. Arrange the apple slices in an 
                overlapping spiral pattern. Each slice should have one edge pressed into the frangipane until it touches the 
                pastry base, and then overlap the previous slice. Start at the outside edge, and work towards the center.</li>
            
            <li>Place the pie plate on top of the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the filling 
                begins to brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for another 10 minutes, 
                then sprinkle sugar over the top of the tart. Return to the oven for 10 more minutes, or until the sugar 
                caramelizes slightly.</li>
            
            <li>Cool the tart on a wire rack. A short time before serving, warm the apricot jelly. Add some water if necessary 
                to make it a liquid consistency. Brush onto the tart for a nice shine.</li>
        </ol>
